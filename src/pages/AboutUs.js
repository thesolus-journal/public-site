        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>
          For over six years, I built my career in the corporate world - a
          journey that provided stability, a competitive income, and valuable
          professional growth. It was a time of structure, learning, and clear
          progression - the one that shaped how I approach work, discipline, and
          value creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, a sudden shift in the organization presented me with a decision
          point - a pivotal moment in my career. It wasn't a matter of right or
          wrong but a question of direction. I was faced with a choice: to
          continue along the well-established path or pause and ask myself where
          I truly wanted to go next.
        </p>
        <p>I chose to pause - and redefine.</p>
        <p>
          Stepping away from the familiar was not an easy choice. Without a job
          title, a corporate structure, or a routine to follow, I found myself
          confronting a deeper set of questions: Who am I beyond a title? What
          do I truly want to create, contribute, and live by?
        </p>
        <p>
          In that space of reflection, I reconnected with the values that matter
          the most to me - integrity, purpose, and the drive to create
          meaningful and lasting impacts. I realized that fulfilment doesn't
          always come from following a conventional path. Sometimes, it comes
          from building your own. That realization gave rise to The Solus.
